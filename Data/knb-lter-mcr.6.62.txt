      These data describe the species abundance and estimated size distributions (total body length to the 
        greatest precision possible) of fishes surveyed as part of MCR LTER's annual reef fish monitoring program. 
        This study began in 2005 and the dataset is updated annually. Data from the initial survey conducted in 2005 
        are presented in a separate data table as the methods used differed from the standard protocol adopted 2006 
        and no estimates of fish body lengths were made.
      
      From 2006 to 2021, the estimated abundances and body lengths of all mobile taxa of fishes (Scarids, Labrids, 
        Acanthurids, Serranids, etc.) observed on a 5 m by 50 m transect extending from the bottom to the surface of the 
        water column were recorded by a single diver using SCUBA. After completing the initial survey, the diver then 
        swam back along a 1 m by 50 m band down the center of the original transect line and recorded the estimated 
        abundances and body lengths of all non-mobile or cryptic taxa of fishes (Pomacentids, Gobiids, Cirrhitids, 
        Holocentrids, etc). Beginning in 2022 to provide an increased degree of diver safety, the abundances and body 
        lengths of fishes on each transect are estimated by a pair of divers using SCUBA. The lead diver estimates the 
        abundances and body lengths of all mobile taxa of fishes (Scarids, Labrids, Acanthurids, Serranids, etc.) 
        observed on a 5 m by 50 m transect extending from the bottom to the surface of the water column, while the 
        second diver trailing approximately 5 m behind the lead diver estimates the abundances and body lengths of all 
        non-mobile or cryptic taxa of fishes (Pomacentids, Gobiids, Cirrhitids, Holocentrids, etc) on a 1 m by 50 m band 
        down the center of the transect.
      
      Surveys are conducted between 0900 and 1600 hours (local time) during late July or early August of each year. 
        Four replicate transects are surveyed in each of six locations on the forereef (two on each of Moorea's three 
        sides), six locations on the backreef (two on each of Moorea's three sides), and on six locations on the fringing 
        reef (two on each of Moorea's three sides) for a total of 72 individual transects. Transects are permanently 
        marked using a series of small, stainless-steel eyebolts affixed to the reef. Transects on the fore reef are 
        located at a depth of approximately 12m, those in the back reef portion of the lagoons are located at a depth of 
        approximately 1.5m and those on the fringing reef are located at a depth of approximately 10m. In addition to the 
        biotic data collected, divers also record data on the date and time that each transect was surveyed, wind speed 
        and sea state, swell height in m, amount of cloud cover in %, and horizontal visibility in m. This monitoring 
        program is consistent with the protocols adopted by the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network and the Australian 
        Institute of Marine Science for use with the Great Barrier Reef Long-term Monitoring Program.

            Diver Observation
            This study began in 2005 and the dataset is updated annually. 
              Data from the initial survey conducted in 2005 are presented in a 
              separate data table as the methods used differed from the standard protocol 
              adopted in 2006 and no estimates of fish body lengths were made. Each year, 
              surveys were conducted between 0900 and 1600 hours (local time) during late 
              July or early August of each year. Four replicate transects were surveyed in 
              each of six locations on the forereef (two on each of Moorea's three sides), 
              six locations on the backreef (two on each of Moorea's three sides), and on 
              six locations on the fringing reef (two on each of Moorea's three sides) for 
              a total of 72 individual transects. Transects are permanently marked using a 
              series of small, stainless-steel eyebolts affixed to the reef. Transects on 
              the fore reef are located at a depth of approximately 12m, those in the back 
              reef portion of the lagoons are located at a depth of approximately 1.5m and 
              those on the fringing reef are located at a depth of approximately 10m.
            
          
          
             2005 Surveys only
             In 2005, a pair of divers using SCUBA swam side by side, down the center of a 5 m by 
              50 m transect.  One diver estimated the abundance of all fishes throughout the entire water 
              column from the bottom to the surface from the center of the transect line out to 2.5 m to 
              the left of the center line, while the other diver estimated the abundances of all fishes 
              throughout the entire water column from the bottom to the surface from the center of the 
              transect line out to 2.5 m to the right of the center line.  Divers did not attempt to 
              estimate the sizes of the fishes observed. Data from this initial survey are presented but 
              should be used with a great deal of caution as divers may have double-counted individuals 
              moving across the 5 m width of the transect or did not count individuals that they mistakenly 
              thought had been counted by the other diver. 
          
          
            2006 - 2021 Surveys
             From 2006 to 2021, the estimated abundances and body lengths (total body length to greatest 
              precision possible) of all mobile taxa of fishes (Scarids, Labrids, Acanthurids, Serranids, etc.) 
              observed on a 5 m by 50 m transect extending from the bottom to the surface of the water column 
              were recorded by a single diver using SCUBA. After completing the initial survey, the diver then 
              swam back along a 1 m by 50 m band down the center of the original transect line and recorded the 
              estimated abundances and body lengths of all non-mobile or cryptic taxa of fishes (Pomacentids, 
              Gobiids, Cirrhitids, Holocentrids, etc).
            
          
          
             2006 - Present Surveys 
             Beginning in 2022 to provide an increased degree of diver safety, the abundance 
              and body lengths of fishes on each transect are estimated by a pair of divers using SCUBA. 
              The lead diver estimates the abundances and body lengths of all mobile taxa of fishes 
              (Scarids, Labrids, Acanthurids, Serranids, etc.) observed on a 5 m by 50 m transect 
              extending from the bottom to the surface of the water column, while the second diver 
              trailing approximately 5 m behind the lead diver estimates the abundances and body 
              lengths of all non-mobile or cryptic taxa of fishes (Pomacentids, Gobiids, Cirrhitids, 
              Holocentrids, etc) on a 1 m by 50 m band down the center of the transect.
            
          
          
            Locations
             Locations for the MCR LTER site annual fish census locations are designated with 
              four components in a stratified design: 6 sites, 3 habitats, 4 transects, 2 swaths 
              (1 m or 5 m transect width. This yields 144 unique locations surveyed each year. 
              The six MCR-LTER sites span the three shores of the roughly triangular island of 
              Moorea with Sites 1 and 2 on the north-facing shore, Sites 3 and 4 on the south-east-
              facing shore, and Sites 5 and 6 on the south-west-facing shore.  Sites on a given 
              side of the island are located at least 3 km apart.  At each site, the three habitats 
              surveyed are the Fringing Reef, the Back Reef area of the lagoon, and Fore Reef. 
              Within each habitat, there are four, 50 m long transects, each of which is surveyed 
              twice.  Once using a 5 m width to census mobile fishes, and once using a 1 m width to 
              census semi-cryptic or more sedentary species. Individual transects within a given site 
              and habitat are positioned end to end parallel to either shore or the barrier reef 
              and are separated by approximately 5 m. 
						
             Caution should be used when analyzing these data as individual transects within a 
              given site and habitat combination may not be statistically independent of each other. 
            
          
          
          
            Dive Conditions
             In addition to the biotic data collected, divers also record data on the date 
              and time each transect was surveyed, wind speed and sea state, swell height in m, 
              amount of cloud cover in %, and horizontal visibility in m. Dive conditions are 
              recorded for each dive, which is unique to a habitat at a site for a given year. 
              Therefore, there are 18 unique dive conditions each year (3 habitats at 6 sites). 
            
          
          
            Divers
             There are four permanent transects established within each of the three habitat 
              types at each of the six sites arrayed around the island.  In 2005, each transect 
              was censused by a pair of divers, each diver estimated the abundance of all fishes 
              on half of the 5 m width of the 50 m long transect.  From 2006 to 2021, each transect 
              was censused by a single diver who estimated the abundances and sizes of all mobile 
              fishes first along a 5 m wide by 50 m long transect and then again along a 1 m wide 
              transect down the center of the original 5 m wide transect to estimate the abundances 
              and body sizes of all semi-cryptic and sedentary species. Whenever possible, the same 
              diver covered the same transect number within each habitat type at each site each 
              year (The diver censusing Transect 3 has varied over time.). Beginning in 2022, each 
              transect again was censused by a pair of divers.  However, unlike in 2005 when the 
              divers swam side by side and each diver censused only half of the 5 m wide transect 
              along the 50 m length, beginning in 2022, The lead diver estimated the abundances 
              and body lengths of all mobile taxa of fishes (Scarids, Labrids, Acanthurids, Serranids, 
              etc.) observed on a 5 m by 50 m transect extending from the bottom to the surface of 
              the water column, while the second diver trailing approximately 5 m behind the lead 
              diver estimates the abundances and body lengths of all non-mobile or cryptic taxa of 
              fishes (Pomacentids, Gobiids, Cirrhitids, Holocentrids, etc) on a 1 m by 50 m band 
              down the center of the transect. Since each diver is counting a different set of 
              species along the entire width of their transect, there is no potential for double 
              counting individuals or assuming that an individual has been counted by the other 
              diver. The diver censusing each transect is identified in the data by their initials. 
              In 2005, the initials of 2 divers are concatenated.

            Estimation of biomass from length
            
							Calculated fish biomass is a wet weight. 
							Fish biomass (body weight in g) is estimated using the formula w = aL^b 
							where L is the fish fork length (FL) in cm and parameters a and b depend on species.
							Parameters were obtained primarily from Kulbicki et al. 2005.
            
							
						Diver observations of fish length are collected and reported in this dataset as total length. 
							The conversion to fork length was determined primarily using FishBase.

              Fish Length and Biomass
              In 2006, divers also began to estimate the size (length) of each
								fish observed to the nearest half cm. 
            
            
              Divers
               At each site, at each habitat, there are four transects, each
								covered by an assigned diver (one diver per transect). Whenever
								possible, the same diver covers the same transect number every year.
								(Transect 3 has varied.) The diver is listed by their initials. The
								diver ID is determined by the year and transect number; there are 4
								unique diver IDs for each year.

              Initial Survey
              This study began in 2005 with an initial survey. Protocol and data
								collected differ from the annual survey in subsequent years. Size
								(fish length) was not collected in 2005.
               In the initial survey in 2005, the Forereef habitat transects at
								sites LTER 1 and LTER 2 were replicated three times. All other sites
								and habitats have one replicate.
            
            
              Divers
               At each site, at each habitat, there are four transects, each
								covered by a pair of assigned divers in 2005.
